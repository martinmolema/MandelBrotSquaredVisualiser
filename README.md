# MandelBrotSquaredVisualiser
Website with interaction to visualise squared complex number with addition 

Please have a look at the sourcecode at [GitHub](https://github.com/martinmolema/MandelBrotSquaredVisualiser) and an excellent explanation at [NumberPhile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk). 
I completely ripped this idea from their video, but the code is all original.

Working example published at my [homepage](http://wiskunde.molema.org/mandelbrot/).

Video available at my [Youtube channel](https://youtu.be/gMz6lNZRe2g).
